                About the Legend
            </h1>
 
             
 
     <p>
             &#10144; Dhoni was born on 7 July 1981 in Ranchi, Bihar (now in Jharkhand). He was raised in a Hindu Rajput family. His parents 
                 belonged to the village of Lwali is in the Lamgara block of Almora District, Uttarakhand. Dhoni’s father, Pan Singh worked in 
                 junior management positions in MECON.<br><br>
            &#10144; On 4 July 2010, Dhoni got married to his schoolmate from DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir, Sakshi Singh Rawat. The couple gave birth 
                 to a beautiful girl on 6 February 2015 and named her Ziva.<br><br>
            &#10144; In 1995, he joined the Commando cricket club and stood behind the stumps for them for the next three years. He was then picked 
                 for the Vinoo Mankad Trophy Under-16 Championship in the 1997/98 season and performed well.<br><br>
            &#10144; In 1998, Dhoni started to play for the Central Coal Fields Limited (CCL) team. During his time at the CCL, Deval Sahay would 
                 gift him fifty rupees for every 6 that he scored in Sheesh Mahal tournament cricket games. Sahay then pushed for Dhoni’s selection 
                 in the Bihar team.<br><br>  
            &#10144; Dhoni was selected in 1998 by Deval Sahay to play for the Central CoalFields Limited (CCL) team. This was the first time that 
                 Dhoni stepped into professional cricket. Dhoni showed exceptional talent which impressed Deval Sahay who used his contacts in 
                Bihar.
                 Cricket Association to push for his selection in the Bihar team.<br><br>  
                
            &#10144; Dhoni debuted for the senior Bihar Ranji Team for the 1999–2000 season. He was also included in the Bihar U-19 squad for the 
                 1998–99 season where he scored 176 runs in 7 innings from 5 matches.<br><br>  
            &#10144;Dhoni however was not picked for the East Zone U-19 squad (CK Nayudu Trophy) or Rest of India squad (MA Chidambaram Trophy and 
                 Vinoo Mankad Trophy). Dhoni made the first-class debut in Ranji Trophy debut for Bihar in the 1999–2000 season. He was just 
                 eighteen-year-old at that moment.<br><br>  
            &#10144; After playing Ranji Trophy for over three years, Dhoni was picked over international cricketer Deep Dasgupta to represent 
                 East Zone. It was then that Dhoni stepped into the limelight. Dhoni was scouted by BCCI’s small-town talent-spotting initiative 
                TRDW and discovered by TRDO Prakash Poddar.<br><br> 
            &#10144; Dhoni was selected for India A squad for a tour of Zimbabwe and Kenya. His performances in that tour earned him the attention 
                 of the likes of Sourav Ganguly and Ravi Shastri. <br><br>  
            &#10144;Dhoni arrived on the international stage when the Indian ODI team was struggling to find it’s Wicketkeeper-Batsman. We saw 
                 Rahul Dravid in the 2000s and then the arrival of wicket-keeper/batsman from the junior ranks such as Parthiv Patel and Dinesh 
                Karthik.<br><br>  
            &#10144; Under Dhoni’s captaincy in the 2015 World Cup held in Australia and New Zealand, the Men in Blue were able to reach the semi- 
                 finals with comfort, beating Bangladesh in the quarter-finals. However, they went on to lose to hosts Australia in the semi-finals 
                at the Sydney Cricket Ground.<br><br> 
            &#10144; India had won 7 consecutive matches in this World Cup and won 11 straight games overall in World Cups. After beating 
                 Bangladesh, MSD became the first non-Australian captain to win 100 ODI matches, and the first Indian captain to hold the record. 
                <br><br>
            &#10144; Dhoni played his last World Cup at the age of 38. This time around, he was India’s wicketkeeper leading into the tournament. 
                 Despite his handy knocks against South Africa, Australia, and West Indies, MSD was primarily criticized for his strike rate and 
                ‘lack of intent’.<br><br> 
            &#10144; Dhoni received India's highest sports honour, the Major Dhyanchand Khel Ratna Award in 2008 for his outstanding achievements 
                 and the Government of India honoured him India's fourth civilian award Padma Shri in 2009 and third civilian award Padma Bhushan 
                in 2018. He is the only cricket captain in the world to win all three of the Cricket World Cup, ICC Men's T20 World Cup and ICC 
                 Champions Trophy.<br><br> 
             &#10144; He announced his retirement from Tests on 30 December 2014,[9] and stepped down as captain of T20Is and ODIs in 2017. On 15 
                 August 2020, Dhoni retired from all formats of international cricket and continues to play in the IPL.
